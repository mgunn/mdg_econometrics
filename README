(1) Compiling mg_getRowsWithKey with mex

Some of the code here uses mg_getRowsWithKey.cpp and you want to compile that using mex. You want to setup mex and issue the command "mex -largeArrayDims  mg_getRowsWithKey.cpp"

Eg. from the command line run something like

matlab -nodisplay -nosplash -r "mex -largeArrayDims  mg_getRowsWithKey.cpp; exit"
